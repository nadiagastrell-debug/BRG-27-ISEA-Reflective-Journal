        <p><em>P.S: I completed previously parts 1 to 6 throughout the course of our Sessions and they are all included in my reflective journey document!. This repository starts from Session 7 onward, which is where our lecturer agreed we could begin to start pushing from since we did not know we needed to push our codes or how</em></p>
