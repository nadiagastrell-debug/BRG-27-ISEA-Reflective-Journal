	<title>Part 7: DNS Configuration.</title>
</head>
<body>
	<p><strong> I was not able to complete this Lab</strong> because it needed a public cloud server and a registered domain name, which I did not have access to.</p>

	<hr>

	<h1> What I needed to complete this.</h1>
	<p> The lab required three thing I did not have:</p>
	<ul>
	     <li>A could server running somehwre on the internet with a public IP address</li>
	     <li>A domain name purchased from somewhere like Namecheap or GoDaddy</li>
	     <li>Access to the DNS management panel to point that domain at my server</li>
	</ul>

	<h2>What I learned anyway</h2>
	<p> Even though I could not do the practical part, I learned how DNS works. Basically, DNS is like the internet's phone book. When you type "google.com" into your browser , DNS transtaltes that name into the actual IP address that computers use to find each other.</p>
	
	<h3> The different types of DNS records:</h3>
	<ul>
	     <li><strong>A record:</strong> This points your domain name to an IPv4 address, which is the most common type.</li>
	     <li><strong>AAA Record:</strong> Same thing but for IPv6 addresses; the newer, longer format.</li>
	     <li><strong>CNAME:</strong> Creates an alias, like making "www.example.com" point to "www.example.com"</li>
	     <li><strong>MX:</strong> Tells emails where to go for your domain</li>
	</ul>

	<h2> What I actually tried</h2> 
	<p> I practiced using the nslookup command to see how DNS works in real scenarios: </p>
	<pre>nslookup google.com</pre>
	<p>This command asks DNS servers what the IP address for google.com is, and they provide you with the answer.</p>

	<p><em>Here is what happened when I looked up google.com</em></p>

	<h2> How it would have worked</h2>
	<p> If I'd had a domain and server, I would have:</p>
	<ol>
	     <li>Logged into my domain registrar's website.</li>
	     <li>Found the DNS management section.</li>
	     <li>Created an A record pointing my domain to my server's IP address.</li>
	     <li>Waited a few hours for the changes to spread accross the internet through DNS propagation.</li>
	     <li>Typed my domain name into a browser and seen my Apache web server appear.</li>
	</ol>

	<p> The whole point is that after setting this up, anyone in the world could type my domain name and reach my server. That is how literally every website on the internet works.</p>
